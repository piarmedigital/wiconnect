In all other cases we delete your personal data with the exception of data we are obliged to store for the fulfillment of legal obligations (e.g., due to retention periods under the tax and commercial codes we are obliged to have documents such as contracts and invoices available for a certain period of time).

<p>
	 You have the right to obtain the rectification of inaccurate personal data. As far as statutory requirements are fulfilled, you have the right to obtain the completion or deletion of your data.

<h3>7.5.1 Objection to direct marketing</h3>
<p>
	 Additionally, you may object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time.

<h3>7.5.2 Objection to data processing based on the legal basis of “legitimate interest”</h3>

<p>
	 In addition, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time, insofar as this is based on “legitimate interest”.

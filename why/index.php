We built revolutionary Wi-Fi onboarding technologies integrated with our powerful advertising platform that turn Wi-Fi networks from cost centers into revenue generators.</p>

<p>Then we turned our attention to the huge advertising opportunity beyond Wi-Fi networks. We created a platform that’s integrated where programmatic advertising overlaps with networks. We built a unique way to recognize and acquire undervalued ad inventory, add value, and resell it in the blink of an eye. The classic “buy-low, sell-high” in the modern advertising age. And, it works on all networks.</p>

<p>The combination of our technologies and platforms combined with our advertising expertise created the ideal solution for advertisers seeking to get their message to a precise audience and obtain the best bang for their buck.</p>
